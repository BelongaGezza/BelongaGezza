### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding in a windowing environment, out if touch since the 1990s command line compiling kernels for Linux
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to get familiar with VS and XCode, starting from the absolute basics. Syntax and logic wont cut it when IDE basics stand in the way.
